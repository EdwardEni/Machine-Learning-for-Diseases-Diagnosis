Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized many fields, including healthcare, by enabling more accurate, faster, and personalized diagnosis of diseases. 
As the availability of medical data continues to grow, machine learning algorithms are becoming indispensable tools for diagnosing diseases, 
#predicting patient outcomes, and improving clinical decision-making.

Machine learning refers to a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. 

In healthcare, ML is primarily applied to 

 1.Classify diseases
 2.Predict patient conditions, and 
 3.Assist in early detection and diagnosis of diseases.

 ML can identify complex relationships between variables, detect subtle patterns, and support the diagnosis of diseases with high accuracy, 
potentially outperforming traditional diagnostic techniques.
